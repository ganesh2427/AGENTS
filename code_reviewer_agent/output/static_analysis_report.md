Due to limitations in accessing and processing the provided files, a complete static analysis report cannot be generated.  However, the above examples demonstrate the format and type of information that would be included in a full report for each file.  The report would include a summary of files analyzed, issues found per file with line numbers, severity classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low), and specific suggestions for fixes for each identified issue.  To generate a complete report, access to the file system and a functioning static analysis tool is required.
